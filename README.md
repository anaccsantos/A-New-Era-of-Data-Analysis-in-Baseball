# A-New-Era-of-Data-Analysis-in-Baseball
There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, I used the "Statcast" data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees. To extract its data, I used Python, Pandas, and data visualization to be able to measure and compare both players data. With the final results I was able to see that Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton are not identical despite their superficial similarities. In terms of home runs, their launch profiles, as well as their pitch speed and location preferences, are different. But opposing pitchers should still be scared of them :)
